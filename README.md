# owo - An osu! Discord bot
This is owo, an instance of Red, an open source Discord bot created by [Twentysix](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) and modified by Stevy for the specific purpose of Osu!.

Key Features include:
- User profiles
- Top/Recent plays
- Score tracking
- Map detection and pp calculation
- Screenshot detection
- Standard map recommendations

You can add the bot using this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=289066747443675143&scope=bot&permissions=305187840) or join the owo server [here](https://discord.gg/aNKde73).

If you would like to run your own instance of owo because tracking is getting too slow or some other reason, please follow the instructions provided by [Twentysix](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/) and others on how to install a Redbot for your system. Then, getting this to work should make more sense. If you're having issues with `leveler.py` and/or `osu.py`, be sure you read up on [my cog repo](https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs) on how to install those two cogs. Have fun! If you have questions/need help, ask in the [owo! Official](https://discord.gg/aNKde73) server.
